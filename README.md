Explaination of the project:

The backstop protocol is an L2 blockchain with an enshrined dispute resolution oracle. Contracts deployed on the ledger benefit from oracles and governance arbitration backstopped by the ability, in extremis, to fork the entire L2 ledger on which they are running. 
We called the project backstop protocol, since the forking mechansim ( splitting a chain into two identifical copies that can evolvue into different states) enshrined ability to resolve conflicts: In each fork, one solution of a conflict can be implemented and users of the ecosystem have to decided which fork they wanna use in the future.
This has been highlighted as the least coersive governance mechansim in literature, since no one is forced to accept an arbitration outcome, but rather time and adaption of the chains will tell which one was the better decision.
