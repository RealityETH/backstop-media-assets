# Explaination


This repo contains files from open source software that we wanna replace. Having an copy with nearly similar size and resolution would be great.

favicon-16x16.png: Is an icon used in the tab header: https://explorer.testnet.backstop.technology/. It would be nice to our icon also transparent, not as my stupid draft

favicon.icon : Same as above
Icon_60_60.svg: Same as above. Current proposal is in the folder Icon, but its tilded.
